## Solution

`0CTF{50m371m35_17_0nly_l00k5_d1ff1cul7_bu7_15n7_4c7u4lly}`

## But How?

### Inspect Elements

Since this was an easy challenge, started with the basics i.e. Inspect Elements.

1. **HTML**

    ```html
    ...
    <!--        0CTF{50m371m35_          -->
    </html>
    ```

2. **CSS**

    ```css
    ...
    /* 17_0nly_l00k5 */
    label {
        font-weight: bold;
    }
    ...
    ```

3. **JS**

    ```javascript
        ...
        loginMessage.style.fontWeight = "bold"; // _d1ff1cul7_bu7
        return; // Stop further execution
    }
    ...
    ```

4. **robots.txt**

    ```plaintext
    ...
    Disallow: /tmp/
    Disallow: _15n7_4c7u4lly}
    Disallow: /wp-admin/
    Disallow: /checkout
    ...
    ```

P.S. : Other possible locations to look for the flag could be in the cookies, local storage, network tab, etc.
